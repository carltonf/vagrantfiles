    #
    # The following block uses a popular plug-in `hostmanager` to manage
    # host/guest hosts files. However, since `hostmanager` is designed for
    # multi-machine environment, it would not update the hosts files of vagrant
    # boxes that are not in the multi-machine configuration. Here I bind-mount
    # host (in my case, windows 10) hosts file to /etc/hosts and in effect the
    # host hosts file serves as local name server that _syncs_ across all vagrant
    # boxes that uses this trick.

    # NOTE: in order for default properties be set by VBox, vboxservice needs to be enabled in guest
    #
    # NOTE: it's possible that at the time the following command is run, the
