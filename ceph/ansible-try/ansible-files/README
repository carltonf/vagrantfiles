Ansible playbook for my own ceph cluster experiment.

It borrowed from https://github.com/ceph/ceph-ansible, with my specific goals
and restrictions.

Goal: understand *in details* how to set up a ceph cluster.

Restrictions:
- The base box is ceph/ubuntu-xenial as recommanded by the ceph-asnible
  upstream.
- For now, only virtualbox case is used.
